# Login System
Login is a set of a person or a userâ€™s credential. At the very least, they consists of a username and a password. However sometimes, depending on the websites or the application, some login may include more information for better security purposes such as PIN number, two-factor authentication and/or, CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to different between Computers and Humans Apart).
